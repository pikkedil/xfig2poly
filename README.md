# xfig2poly
Convert xfig into poly format. The [xfig format](http://mcj.sourceforge.net/index.html) has a very 
simple data structure. At the same time it can be used to model very complex structures. In this
project the basic idea is to create a geometrical machine model of an electrical machine. The model
is then converted to a [.poly](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Equake/triangle.poly.html) file to be used 
with [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html).
